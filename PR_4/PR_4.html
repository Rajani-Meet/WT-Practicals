                <h3>History</h3>
            <br>
            <p>
                Kedarnath, a popular Hindu temple, tucked away in the lap of Garhwal Himalayas, some 221 km from Rishikesh in Uttarakhand, is one of the twelve Jyotirlinga temples of Lord Shiva. Lying against the backdrop of the magnificent Kedarnath Mandir Range, at an altitude of 3580 meters, the splendid Kedarnath Dham is where the devotees come seeking the blessings of Lord Shiva. Kedarnath Mandir is said to have been constructed by Adi Shankaracharya in the 8th century A.D. The nearby flowing Mandakini River, mesmerizing vistas and splendid sceneries in the form of the snow-clad mountains, rhododendron forests, and salubrious environment make Kedarnath Dham Yatra, a tranquil and picturesque place to be at.

            <p>   The devotees experience immense peace of mind while undertaking a Kedanath temple spiritual tour. The temple and nature’s milieu is so divine that it always rekindles human beings’ faith in the Almighty. The temple has survived one of the worst flash floods in 2013 of all time in the state, hence enhancing its sacredness and the mystique in the eyes of the devotees. Devotees flock to Kedarnath pilgrimage tour site every year,as a part of Chardham Yatra circuit.

                There are more than 200 shrines dedicated to Lord Shiva in Chamoli district of Uttarakhand itself, the most important one is Kedarnath. According to legend, the Pandavas after having won over the Kauravas in the Kurukshetra war, felt guilty of having killed their own Kith and Kin and sought blessings of Lord Shiva for redemption. He eluded them repeatedly and while fleeing took refuge at Kedarnath in the form of a bafellow.
                The Temple at Kedarnath presents an imposing sight, standing in middle of a wide plateau surrounded by lofty snow covered peaks. The temple was originally built in 8th century A.D. by Jagad Guru Adi Shankaracharya and stands adjacent to site of an even earlier temple built by the Pandavas. The inner walls of the assembly hall are decorated with figures of various deities and scenes from mythology. Outside the temple door a large statue of the Nandi Bafellow stands as guard.
